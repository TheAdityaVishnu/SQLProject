# Hostel Management

For Information Management project, I have chosen to represent the various accommodation hostels of Trinity College. This model has various entities like Hostel Details, Student Details, Staff Details, Room Details, Complaint Details and Feedback Details.

For this database, there are numerous hostels, and for each hostel there are several students and rooms, and subsequently each hostel also employs several staff. For each room there can be multiple complaints and feedback on those complaints lodged.
